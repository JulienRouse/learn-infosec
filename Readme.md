# Learning infosec

Here is the start of my journey toward learning about infosec.
I'll begin with the video from [hacker101](https://www.hacker101.com) aptly named ['Introduction'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLxhvVyxYRviZsAKXZEbmfsVMZp3s0KaVE&v=zPYfT9azdK8&feature=emb_logo) (December 2017, not too bad but might have some outdated content)

  - especially this course: [hack yourself first](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=ac3a1568-a97b-4017-badf-0c3fd0250268) on pluralsight looks free even without sign up.

## Certification recommandation

- ## From [NetworkChuck feat The Cyber Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIt_VAM4q-Y)
  - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9Eulfpffg&list=PLLKT\_\_MCUeiycd-\_VvfM1xI9t4uEV0g8i](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing/): most well rounded up certification. Teach you Active Directory hacking, very good for the education, but HR has no idea what this is.
  - [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) 800-1300\$, 30-90days of lab time, you get a lot of practice (if you have the time). The exam is to hack 5 boxes. Downside is no methodologie for security, no wireless hacking.
    200h, 5h/day for The Cyber Mentor
    (~90-130K in USA for junior position)
  - [SANS GPEN](https://www.giac.org/certification/penetration-tester-gpen) 7000\$ but very good if your employer pays it. It prepares very good.
